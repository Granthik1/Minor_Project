# Stock Price Prediction

I have been actively engaged in a data science project focused on
stock price prediction, utilizing the methodology of Linear Regression. It's worth noting that
the project is presently in the ongoing development phase. Accurate prediction systems for
the stock market assist traders, investors, and analysts in anticipating market trends, aiding
successful investment strategies. I completed this project during my Data Science Internship
at Corizo.
